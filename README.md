PROJECT OVERVIEW
Data Structure:
We will use a dictionary to store grades for each subject or assignment. Each key in the dictionary will represent a subject or assignment, and its corresponding value will be a list of grades entered by the user.

Functions:
add_grades: Allows the user to input grades for a specific subject or assignment.
calculate_average: Computes the average grade across all subjects or assignments.
calculate_gpa: Converts the average grade into a letter grade or GPA based on a typical grading scale.

User Interface:
The program will interact with the user via a command-line interface (CLI), providing clear prompts for input and displaying results.
